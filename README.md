# SunDevilPizza
The goal of this project is to create a mock, visual application for order pickups at "Sun Devil Pizza" with three distinct views for Customer, Processing Agent, and Chef.

Customers may place customizable pizza orders for pickup and view the order status. 
Customers will be ASU students and use their ASU ID's to complete their order placement.

A Processing Agent may use the application to review orders placed and confirm them for the Chef.

A Chef may use the application to begin cooking confirmed orders and to finalize the orders for pickup.

Orders are stored in a text file in the main directory under "orders.txt" and are stored in the format of:
  0. Order ID
  1. Student ID
  2. Order Status
  3. Pickup Time
  X. Order Information
